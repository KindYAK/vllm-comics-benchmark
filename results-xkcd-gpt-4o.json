As the days progress, it becomes hopeful about returning home (Panel 10) and questions its performance (Panel 2, Panel 8). After the mission's expected end (Panel 3), the rover continues working, facing challenges like analyzing rocks (Panel 5) and enduring a sandstorm (Panel 6). Despite being stuck (Panel 1), it remains hopeful and questions if it did well enough to return (Panel 4). The final panel (Panel 7) emphasizes its solitude and perseverance.\n\nThe correct order of the panels is", "failed": false}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/2459-March2020.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_3.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_5.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_0.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_5.jpg"], "correct_order": [12, 13, 2, 0, 8, 14, 11, 5, 1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 6, 3], "predicted_order": [12, 13, 6, 10, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14], "reasoning": "Default reasoning due to retries exhausted.", "failed": true}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/1928-SevenYears.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_9.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_9.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_10.jpg"], "correct_order": [18, 12, 9, 5, 2, 6, 15, 10, 7, 0, 14, 19, 3, 1, 8, 16, 17, 4, 11, 13], "predicted_order": [0, 3, 5, 18, 2, 12, 8, 19, 4, 13, 11, 6, 10, 15, 16, 17, 1, 7, 9, 14], "reasoning": "**Panel Analysis\n**\n\n1.

A stick figure is holding a small Earth, while a cat is playing with it.\n\n**Overall Plot\n**\n\nThe comic seems to be a humorous take on explaining the size of the Earth and Moon using a basketball analogy. It starts with the narrator attempting to explain the concept, but various interruptions and distractions occur, such as people interacting with the Earth model, a cat playing with it, and a large wave scenario. The repeated attempts to explain the analogy are humorously thwarted by these interruptions.\n\n**Correct Order of the Panels", "failed": false}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/1028-Communication.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_5.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_13.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "correct_order": [16, 10, 8, 11, 1, 0, 13, 9, 6, 14, 12, 17, 2, 4, 7, 5, 15, 3], "predicted_order": [4, 0, 13, 6, 5, 7, 1, 8, 9, 10, 3, 15, 2, 16, 11, 14, 12, 17], "reasoning": "**Panel Analysis\n**\n\n1.

Initially, characters are seen walking and thinking about each other or warning signs. As they interact, they discuss these thoughts, leading to confusion or realization. The warning sign likely represents a gap or danger, which is ignored, leading to a fall. The sequence of events suggests a progression from individual thoughts to interactions, misunderstandings, and finally, the consequence of ignoring the warning.\n\n**The correct order of the panels is", "failed": false}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/997-WaitWait.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_9.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_9.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "correct_order": [18, 12, 9, 5, 2, 6, 15, 10, 7, 0, 14, 19, 3, 1, 8, 16, 17, 4, 11, 13], "predicted_order": [0, 7, 5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "reasoning": "Panel 1\n A headline about Sagal's wife leaving after an affair suggests personal turmoil.\nPanel 2\n Sagal's ghost being captured implies a supernatural or metaphorical event.\nPanel 3\n NPR canceling a news quiz indicates a professional setback.\nPanel 4\n Sagal is upset over DNA harvesting, hinting at privacy concerns.\nPanel 5\n An incomplete headline with \"accidentally\" suggests an unfinished or mysterious event.\nPanel 6\n Sagal is fired after a racist tirade, indicating a major controversy.\nPanel 7\n Sagal stabs Carl Kasell in an on-air dispute, showing a dramatic conflict.\nPanel 8\n Sagal's heart is stolen by Lakshmi Singh, suggesting a romantic subplot.\nPanel 9\n Sagal nearly dissected in an autopsy mistake, adding a darkly humorous twist.\nPanel 10\n Sagal's Kermit fantasy is revealed, adding a quirky personal detail.\nPanel 11\n Sagal deletes his Facebook account, indicating a withdrawal from social media.\nPanel 12\n Sagal wakes an eldritch terror, introducing a fantastical element.\nPanel 13\n Sagal quits a race for a top spot, suggesting a career decision.\nPanel 14\n A documentary on losing on \"Wait Wait\" implies a satirical take on failure.\nPanel 15\n Sagal's protest is raided, showing activism and conflict with authority.\nPanel 16\n Sagal's poison ivy ordeal adds a humorous personal struggle.\nPanel 17\n Sagal is more than just a piece of meat, suggesting objectification issues.\nPanel 18\n Sagal rebukes the Pope, indicating a bold or controversial stance.\nPanel 19\n Sagal in a hostage standoff, adding a dramatic and dangerous situation.\nPanel 20\n Sagal involved in a scandal, indicating legal or ethical trouble.\n\nThe overall plot seems to be a satirical and exaggerated portrayal of Peter Sagal's life, filled with personal, professional, and fantastical challenges.
