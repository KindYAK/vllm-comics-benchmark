a wind turbine (Panel 1), which quickly escalates as it begins to crack (Panel 2) and ultimately explodes (Panel 3). The characters react with fear and humor, blaming Al Gore for the impending disaster (Panel 5). As they discuss their unease about the turbines (Panel 6), the situation worsens with multiple turbines showing signs of distress (Panel 7). The characters realize they need to act (Panel 9), leading to the introduction of a heroic figure (Panel 10). The narrative contrasts the chaos with a serene view of turbines (Panel 11) and ends with a character expressing discomfort about the turbines' appearance (Panel 12), culminating in another explosion

Another stick figure appears, preparing to perform a trick shot while holding a balloon (Panels 3 and 4). The trick shot is executed as the basketball swishes through the hoop (Panel 6). The first stick figure observes and is impressed (Panel 7), leading to an explanation of the trick shot (Panel 8). A humorous time jump occurs, showing the hoop again after 1500 years (Panel 9), with the original stick figure still puzzled (Panel 10). The comic concludes with the stick figure preparing to attempt the trick shot again, humorously reiterating the concept (Panels 12-16).\n\nThe correct order of the panels is", "failed": false}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/1606-FiveDayForecast.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_26.jpg", "panel_21.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_29.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_22.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_28.jpg", "panel_23.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_20.jpg", "panel_25.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_24.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_27.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_26.jpg", "panel_29.jpg", "panel_23.jpg", "panel_21.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_22.jpg", "panel_24.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_28.jpg", "panel_25.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_20.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_27.jpg"], "correct_order": [27, 16, 7, 26, 23, 11, 3, 15, 21, 12, 19, 28, 22, 6, 5, 24, 25, 10, 2, 8, 17, 1, 9, 14, 20, 18, 0, 29, 13, 4], "predicted_order": [0, 4, 14, 1, 2, 3, 16, 24, 5, 9, 20, 21, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 23, 25, 17, 15, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29], "reasoning": "Default reasoning due to retries exhausted.", "failed": true}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/1028-Communication.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_5.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_5.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg"], "correct_order": [16, 10, 8, 11, 1, 0, 13, 9, 6, 14, 12, 17, 2, 4, 7, 5, 15, 3], "predicted_order": [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], "reasoning": "Default reasoning due to retries exhausted.", "failed": true}, {"panels_path": "data/xkcd/417-TheManWhoFellSideways.jpg", "imgs_original": ["panel_25.jpg", "panel_23.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_21.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_26.jpg", "panel_22.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_20.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_24.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_27.jpg"], "imgs_predicted": ["panel_25.jpg", "panel_18.jpg", "panel_3.jpg", "panel_9.jpg", "panel_14.jpg", "panel_21.jpg", "panel_17.jpg", "panel_2.jpg", "panel_26.jpg", "panel_1.jpg", "panel_23.jpg", "panel_13.jpg", "panel_19.jpg", "panel_6.jpg", "panel_22.jpg", "panel_7.jpg", "panel_20.jpg", "panel_10.jpg", "panel_24.jpg", "panel_8.jpg", "panel_12.jpg", "panel_4.jpg", "panel_15.jpg", "panel_16.jpg", "panel_5.jpg", "panel_0.jpg", "panel_11.jpg", "panel_27.jpg"], "correct_order": [25, 15, 11, 3, 21, 24, 10, 14, 19, 4, 17, 26, 20, 6, 5, 22, 23, 9, 2, 7, 16, 8, 13, 1, 18, 0, 12, 27], "predicted_order": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], "reasoning": "Default reasoning due to retries exhausted.", "failed": true}]
